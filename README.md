## Item trade
You ever had an item that was useless for you but useful for your friend? Worry not!
With this mod you're able to trade (actually give) items to players in the lobby.
Or make yourself useless and your friend OP by giving all your items!

Usage:
F7 to open the trading window

If anything weird occurs, ping me in the HoH modding channel on discord or post a message here regarding the error.


### How do I enable mods?
1. Click the "Profiles" button in the main menu. (It's the button left of the Singleplayer button)

2. Click "Clone this profile" so that you have a secondary profile to use for modding. (Note: Enabling mods on a profile disables achievements for that profile!)

3. Click the "Change mods" button (the button with the cog) for the secondary profile. (You might be asked whether you're sure you want to continue adding mods, click Yes.)

4. Select the mods you want to use and click OK. Mods are now enabled on that profile!

Have fun!
