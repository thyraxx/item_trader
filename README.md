## Item trade
You ever had an item that was useless for you but useful for your friend? Worry not!
With this mod you're able to trade (actually give) items to players in the lobby.
Or make yourself useless and your friend OP by giving all your items!

Usage:
F7 to open the trading window

If anything weird occurs, ping me in the HoH modding channel on discord or post a message here regarding the error.
